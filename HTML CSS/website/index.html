Introduction
</h1>
<br />


<!-- normal paragraphs are stylized using CSS -->
<p>
This website is the result of a desire to understand the scheduler component of an Operating System. <br />
The outcome of this website is due to research into Scheduling by various Authors in the field.<br />
</p>

<h3>
Audience
</h3>
<br />

<p>
If you have a interest in Operating Systems and would like to know how they co-ordinate processes and threads 
then this site is for you. <br /> <br />
If you are an IT professional or Computer science student you will feel right at home.<br /> <br/>
If you simply have an interest then you don't even need any experience. Jump straight to the Glossary and understand
some core terms then follow the website.
<!-- line break -->
<br />
I hope that you will gain some understanding and this site will provide some foundations for further research.
</p>

<!-- a smaller sub heading -->
<h3>
Why
</h3>
<br />

<p>
I could find no other website that provided general knowledge about Operating System schedulers. 
There are sites that focus on various Scheduling concepts for particular operating systems such as Linux, 
Unix and Windows but nothing which helps provide a basis for in depth analysis.
