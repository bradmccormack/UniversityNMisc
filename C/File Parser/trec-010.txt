<img src="martract.gif" align="left" hspace=10 >The compost process combines the natural organic materials of sawdust with 

sludge, the bi-product of waste water treatment. Over a period of 30 days the 

mixture of organic materials is processed within a special reactor silo. Forced 

air enhances the work of normal bacteria to break down the wood and waste in a 

manner similar to leaves turning to soil on the forest floor. The process, 

completed under the controlled conditions of the reactor, is much faster. Once 

the mixtue is allowed to cure for another 20 days, it is then ready to use as a soil enhancer.

<p>

The sawdust is used with an equal mix of biosolids to make the compost. Sawdust is a bi-product of the lumber industry and, like sludge, was previously disposed of at a land fill. The sawdust, because of its fine texture, breaks down faster than other amendments such as wood chips, that may also be used in the composting process, Sawdust also provides a consistent compost which is very important to many users, especially golf courses, where it is used in the most demanding situations such as on their greens. Compost applied properly will enhance growth of grass, flowers, shrubs, etc. by improving the basic soils.</p>

<p>

Recycling is good for the environment and in many cases good business. Prior to making compost, the City of Geneva spent approximately $160,000 in land fill fees per year to dispose of the waste water treatment sludge. The operation of making compost costs approximately $90,000 per year and the final compost product is sold for nearly half that amount. In short, recycling netted a savings of approximately $110,000 per year over the previous manner of doing business.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<p><h4> Biosolids compost is a clean, pathogen-free soil enhancer. The 

product produced by the March Creek Waste Water Treatment Plant meets all New 

York State and Federal standards. The material is sold throughout New York State as AllGro <tT><I>TM</I></TT>, &quot;an 

all purpose organic compost &amp; natural fertilizer.&quot;</p>

<p>

Compost is a foundation element of organic and biological agriculture. As mentioned earlier is is weed free making it an ideal enhancer. It is particularly beneficial for sub-standard earth. Building contractors will find it ideal for mixing with soils of high clay and sand content. Landscapers and nursery  professionals will find it ideal to prevent weed growth when used as mulch. Turf professionals may use it as a dressing for golf courses and cemeteries enhance growth and endurance.</P>

<p>

Geneva residents may pickup compost for non-commercial use. The product may be also purchased in bulk quaniities. Contact the Marsh Creek Wastewater Plant at (315) 789-8040 for details.</p>

<H1>The Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity</H1>
</CENTER>
In 1981, the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity (CSTO) opened in Los Angeles 
as a medical practice specially designed to assist in the treatment of and research 
and education for the morbidly obese.  An additional office opened in 1990 in the 
Long Beach area.  However, the Center's reputation for successfully treating severely overweight 
people extends beyond Southern California; patients are referred from all states 
in the Continental US as well as from abroad.<BR>
<BR>
Bariatric Surgery is the exclusive concern of the Center for Surgical Treatment of 
Obesity.  This concentrated focus has provided Dr. Mathias Fobi with the basis for 
perfecting the Fobi-Pouch for Obesity procedure and providing his patients with a 
safe, well tolerated and very effective method to lose weight and maintain weight loss.<BR>
<BR>
The Medical Staff of the CSTO continues research and education to treat obesity and 
provides information that will assist in unlocking the genetic mystery behind obesity. 
 Dr.Fobi is internationally recognized for his efforts and is frequently asked to 
lecture on his findings..  The CSTO participates in several professional organizations, 
including the American Society for Bariatric Surgery, the North American Association 
for the Study of Obesity and the American College of Clinical Nutrition.<BR>
<BR>
Dr. Mathias Fobi received his M.D. at the University of Cincinnati in 1974.  His advanced 
training was at Martin Luther King Jr. Hospital, Los Angeles (residency and internship),

<H1>Patient Testimonials</H1>
At the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity, we have learned from our patients, 
how, in their years of battling weight problems, they were very isolated and shied 
away from any attention.  They were reluctant to talk about themselves or the troubles 
they've experienced while being overweight.  Now that these same patients have conquered 
their weight problem, they want to tell the world about all the wonderful things 
that are happening to them.  And we say that a picture is worth a thousand words 
-- but here is a little of both, straight from some of our patients.<BR>
<BR>

<img align = left src = "bkandy.jpg"><pre>


</pre><DD> <STRONG>Kandy Wendell</STRONG> knew that being overweight was killing her. <BR> She spent more than her time in an Emergency 
Room from significant health problems associated with being overweight.  She suffered 
from high blood pressure, diabetes, agonizing headaches and she had difficulty breathing and walking.  At this point, she weighed 350 lbs.<BR>
<BR>
"I was a true couch potato," she admits, "I would come home from work and go immediately 
to bed because I was so exhausted.-- Can you imagine what's it like to carry an extra 
200 lbs?  It's like being on a chain gang!"  If she didn't get rid of her excess 
weight, she dreaded what her life was going to be.<BR>
<BR>
She remembers the day that she overheard a coworker, also a patient of the Center 
for Surgical Treatment of Obesity, being complimented on how well she looked after 
losing weight.  "I had to know how she did it, " thought Kandy.  When she did find 
out, she took the information to her family physician who helped her determine that this method 
could help her, too.  Her family was also supportive, so it made it easier to make 
this decision -- one that she doesn't regret.  <BR>
<BR>
Kandy scheduled her surgery in February 1994 and , at age 47, maintains her weight 
at 160 lbs.<BR>
<BR>
"I'm proud of my decision and I am actually participating in life, now."  Walking, 
dancing and an increased social life are now part of her regular activities.  Kandy 
talks about what it was like to be out with friends and only being able to watch 
from the fringes because her weight and health problems limited her from doing things that 
are second nature now.<BR>
<BR>
"I really believe that I was given a second chance at life.  I feel better and I look 
forward to every day."  Her medical problems are a thing of the past, too.  Her doctors 
report that her medical numbers (high blood pressure, diabetes, triglycerides, cholesterol) are text book perfect.

 Health problems also plagued <B>Ken Sullivan</B>, too.  Within three years of a post coronary 
bypass, he started again to have problems.  The wife of a friend, also a physician, 
was a patient of Dr. Fobi's.  He recommended that Ken find out if he would be considered a suitable candidate.<BR>
<BR>
At 352 lbs, Ken realized that he had few options left.  Weight problems confounded 
him most of his life.  "I was always on a diet with an 'up and down' success -- the 
more I would lose, the more I would gain back."<BR>
<BR>
In June 1994, at age 43, Ken had the surgery.  Two years post surgery, he maintains 
his weight at 187 lbs.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, he's had some help maintaining his weight.  Patients who have the burden 
of the excess weight lifted find out it's much easier and more enjoyable to be active. 
 Within 30 days of the surgery, his physician friend helped him on a bike, and he 
hasn't stopped yet!<BR>
<BR>
"I love it!  I ride daily now.  The first rides were hard but it's something I really 
enjoy now."  Ken will be participating in a "Ride Across America"  and he has also 
ridden in Spain and Italy.  This is something he wouldn't have even comprehended 
doing at 163 lbs heavier.<BR>
<BR>
And his only regret:  "I wish I would have had the surgery 10 years ago!"

<IMG SRC="franf.jpg" ALT="Fran Before">
<STRONG>Fran Caban</STRONG> was the epitomy of a "little person trapped in a big body."  At age 48, 
she currently weighs a slim 114 lbs.  Before Fran had her surgery in September 1989, 
she weighed 319 lbs.  She proudly confesses that she dropped from a size 52 dress 
to a size 4!<BR>
<BR>
Fran started having weight problems after she had had her children.  "I started gaining 
weight and became depressed when I couldn't lose it -- then I'd turn to food for 
comfort."  Health problems set in.  She was having back problems, embolisms, leg 
clots and gall bladder attacks.  "My liver was totally encased in fat."<BR>
<BR>
Fran was also aware that people treated her differently because she was overweight. 
 She was ignored or treated rudely by people who didn't realize that it wasn't her 
choice to remain overweight.<BR>
<BR>
Fran started noticing a woman in her church who was losing weight and got up the courage 
to ask her how she did it.  At that point, she made a conscious decision that this 
was something she needed to do, too.  "This decision changed my life -- it saved 
my life!"<BR>
<BR>
The surgery is only the beginning she reminds anyone who is considering this.  "I 
changed my eating habits and I exercise now.  But now, I can do things with my grandkids 
that I couldn't do with my kids."

If you are considering surgery for treatment of severe obesity, you will want to make 
an appointment to discuss this further.  The initial visit at the Center for Surgical 
Treatment for Obesity is free, provided that you have had no other bariatric surgery.<BR>
<BR>
At this consultation, Dr. Fobi and the rest of the staff will make a comprehensive 
medical evaluation to determine if you would be a successful candidate for the surgery. 
You would be considered a good candidate if:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> you are at least 75 lbs over your ideal weight;<BR>
<LI> you have not had success with other diet plans;<BR>
<LI> you are between the ages of 10 and 75;<BR>
<LI> you do not have a drug or alcohol problem  (Patients will be      considered If they 
have completed treatment and/or have at least one     year of  sobriety); <BR>
<LI> you do not suffer from any severe psychoemotional or medical problems<BR>
that would make surgery unnecessarily risky.<BR>
<BR>
</UL>
Many insurance companies recognize the long-term benefits of this operation and provide 
coverage for it.  However, as with any surgery, preauthorization is necessary.  This 
can take as little as 2 to 5 weeks, or up to a year, based on your insurance company's philosophy  on this as a weight loss option.  Surgery will be scheduled accordingly. 
 If you do not have insurance coverage, and still want to have the surgery, you will 
be given a list of fees that you will need to pay prior to surgery.<BR>
<BR>
The hospital stay consists of 4 days, barring any complications.  You would be admitted 
on the day of the surgery and be discharged after four days.   The Fobi Pouch operation 
is a vertical banded gastric bypass which reduces the stomach size from its original 3000 cc capacity to 30 cc.  When you eat, the pouch will fill quickly, giving 
a full, satiated feeling.<BR>
<BR>
While each person recovers, from any illness or surgery, at a differing rate, it generally 
takes about six weeks to recover from any major abdominal operation.  At first, while 
your stomach is healing, you will be restricted on the amount and type of foods you can eat.   As it heals, you will gradually be introduced to your normal types 
of foods, however, the quantity will be drastically reduced.  However, because the 
size of your stomach has also been decreased, you will not feel hungry, which is 
typical in conventional diets.  You will consult with the patient counselor prior to leaving 
the hospital to help you with dietary changes and expectations.  You will also be 
given a vitamin regimen to begin.<BR>
<BR>
You will be encouraged to begin light activity, especially walking.  This is to aid 
in the healing process of the surgery as well as beginning the lifestyle changes 
that makes this program successful.  However, as the weight comes off, you will find 
that doing things, like walking, will be easier and more enjoyable for you.<BR>
<BR>
If you have a desk job, you can expect to return to work within three weeks.  If your 
job requires more physical activity, such as bending, lifting or stretching, you 
may return to work in six weeks.<BR>
<BR>
The Center For Surgical Treatment of Obesity has a patient counselor on staff to assist you in all phases of your treatment.  Debbie Kearns is a former patient who has lost 135 lbs since her surgery in 1995.  Debbie will answer any questions about pre and post surgery and will be there to help all patients during their weight loss period.  This may range from diet questions , surgery expectations to the emotional rollercoaster you may have as you encounter the changes that accompany your weight loss.<BR>
<BR>
Your association with the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity <STRONG>only begins</STRONG>
 with your surgery.  Follow up visits are scheduled at seven days post surgery, six 
weeks, three months, twelve months and yearly thereafter.  There is no charge for 
these visits as it is important for the Center to track your progress.<BR>
<BR>
The Center also schedules monthly support group meetings in the Long Beach, CA and 
Las Vegas areas. These meetings provide an opportunity for patients, and those awaiting 
surgery, to work through problems that may be encountering as well as reveling in 
the joy of others' successes.  For patients residing out of the area, a monthly newsletter 
helps keep these patients supported and they are encouraged to call the office monthly, 
to check in with the Center staff.<BR>

<H1>Introduction</H1>

Americans have an obsession about dieting.  There are countless articles and advertisement 
for programs and products offering solutions to our weight problems.<BR>
<BR>
For the severely overweight person, clinically termed as morbidly obese at 75 lbs 
over ideal weight, diets offer a hollow promise of success.  <BR>
<BR>
We hear of people talking about losing the same 15 lbs, over and over again.  This 
"lose and gain" cycle is known as the <STRONG>yo-yo syndrome</STRONG>
.   As difficult as dieting may be for the person needing only to lose 15 lbs, what 
can this be like for the person needing to lose 75, 100, 150 lbs or  more?<BR>
<BR>
The severely overweight person faces challenges that a person, at their ideal weight, 
cannot fathom.  Many may be on a starvation diet while friends and relatives scrutinize 
their eating habits -- convinced that they are sneaking food.  Overweight people 
also face discrimination -- in jobs and social situations; even the clothes they need 
usually cost more!  Many can't enjoy the simple things that most Americans take for 
granted -- like going to the movies, riding on a roller coaster, even walking up 
stairs or tieing shoes is a major ordeal.<BR>
<BR>
As a person gains weight and becomes more difficult to move around, the inactivity 
results in an increased  weight gain.  It becomes a vicious cycle.<BR>
<BR>
There has been much attention to the recent discovery of the "obesity gene."  This 
coincides with research conducted by Dr. Fobi to indicate that Obesity is a hereditary 
disease. This can explain how an entire family, except one person, can be overweight, 
while diet and other lifestyle habits are the same.  Some of the other findings of 
Dr. Fobi include:<BR>
1) Less than 2% of the Severely Obese population is affected by what we call "hormonal 
  imbalance."<BR>
2) Less than 2% of the Severely  Obese population has what can be classified as morbid 
 obesity due to  an eating disorder.<BR>
3) While obesity is not a psychological or psychiatric problem, people who are obese 
  may be more prone to psychological or psychiatric disorders.<BR>
<STRONG><CITE>And most importantly,<BR>
</CITE></STRONG>
4) Obesity is not a problem of willpower.  Obesity is a disease!  It can be treated 
by a <BR>
person with strong willpower, but the success rates are still less than .01%.<BR>
<BR>
The National Institute of Health makes regular studies of obesity.  In 1991 and '92, 
consensus statements were issued rebutting conventional diets for morbid obesity. 
 In summary, these two statements had two important facts: 1) that diets alone have 
not been successful for the morbidly obese and 2) in the first year,  66% of dieters will 
regain their weight loss.  When you consider a diet program, consider this fact: 
No diet program is a permanent answer to weight loss, however, bariatric surgery 
is the only method endorsed to provide such a solution for the morbidly obese.<BR>
<BR>
Bariatrics is the branch of medicine that deals with the treatment of obesity.  The 
physicians at  the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity are Bariatric Surgeons, 
meaning that the obesity treatment is through surgery, combined with lifestyle changes. 
 There are no medications, fad diets, herbs, hypnosis, etc. involved.<BR>
<BR>
Bariatric Surgery had a strong popular awareness in the 1960's when "stomach stapling" 
was at an all time peak.  But  the history of bariatric surgery has roots beginning 
over a hundred years ago when this surgery was prescribed for patients suffering 
from ulcers.  It was discovered that the surgery had a built in side-effect; the patients 
also lost weight!   In 1981, Dr. Mathias Fobi opened the Center for Surgical Treatment 
of Obesity for the purpose of education, treatment and continuing research of obesity.  The procedure exclusively performed by the Center for Surgical Treatment of Obesity 
is the vertical transected gastric bypass with a silastic ring stoma, more commonly 
referred to as "the Fobi-Pouch."<BR>
<BR>
Many people may consider Bariatric Surgery to be a radical approach to combating a 
problem of "willpower."  In reviewing this information, and with physicians and patients 
who show long term, successful results of the procedures, you can determine that 
the complications of obesity are greater than the complications of this surgery.  Bariatric 
Surgery isn't for everyone, but for those who do have the surgery and lose weight, 
they also lose the symptoms of major medical conditions.  These  include:  high blood pressure, increased incidence of cancer, diabetes, strokes and heart disease, circulatory 
problems, sleep apnea, pulmonary problems, etc.<BR>
<BR>
In the 15 years of operation,  Dr. Fobi has found this version of bariatric surgery 
to be most effective for his patients.  This procedure has eliminated many of the 
common fallacies about bariatric surgery, such as "staples bursting" or "stomach 
stretching" etc.  Over 6,000 patients have been treated since the Center opened.<BR>
<BR>
If you, or a friend or loved one, suffers from morbid obesity, we encourage you to 
visit our other web pages.  This is the first step in taking control of your life.<BR>
