Hi Shekhar,
With regards to the order processing page, do we pull the address information we have already collected about the user and simply display it to them or do we give them an opportunity to change it?  If we do allow them to change it, should we be updating their user details or storing it against that particular order?
Thanks,
Terry

There is no change required at that stage, simply display the information.
