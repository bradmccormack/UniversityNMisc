<h1>
Batch/ Non-Preemptive Scheduling
</h1>
<br />


<p>
In non-preemptive scheduling a process will execute until it is finished completing its CPU burst.

<h3>
First Come First Served (FCFS)/ First In First Out (FIFO)
</h3>
<br />


<p>
This is one of the simplest scheduling algorithms. Requests are serviced in the order that they are placed.
</p>

<p class="reference">
(A Dhotre 2009, 5-4)
</p>

<p>
FCFS does not guarantee good through put. It also does not provide the fastest service. 
There are no optimizations to reduce seek time. The major advantage of FCFS is that the algorithm is easy to implement.
</p>

<p class="reference">
(I.A Dhotre 2009, 5-4)
</p>

<p>
When the first job enters the system it is allowed to run as long as it wants to until it is complete. 
It is not pre-empted if it has run to long.
</p>

<p class="reference">
(Andrew S Tanenbaum 3e 2009, 150).
</p>

<p>
As jobs come in they are put onto the end of the queue. When the running process blocks the next process is started from the head of the queue.
</p>

<p class="reference">
(Andrew S Tanenbaum 3e 2009, 150)
</p>

<p>
It is also possible to do the reverse. You could add a new process to the head of the queue and get the next process from the tail, 
as long as the next process to be retrieved is the first process that was added.
</p>

<p>
An example of a FCFS implementation can be demonstrated by showing a disk request queue. 
Suppose it contains references for blocks on tracks 76,124, 17, 269, 201,29 and 137. 
If you see Fig 5.1 you can see how the head moves from track 76,  moves 48 tracks along to 124 and son on.

<p>
Please see Fig 5.1 FCFS scheduling algorithm.<br />
A simple diagram may also help clarify the queuing model of FCFS scheduling with I/O. Please see Fig 5.4 for this.
