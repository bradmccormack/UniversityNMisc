Assignment2


Notes-
I found this assignment very challenging. I left it towards the end (last 3 days). I severely underestimated it :-(.
I was focusing on my Job/Family etc and didn't pay enough time to the assignment.

If I had more time I would apply my learnings in my job such as RAII principles. I should be letting the compiler
manage memory and use stack vars where appropriate. I also feel there is not enough seperation for MVC in my design
but I left it too late to clean it up. 

The class diagram is located in the same root directory as the assignment and is called "class diagram.png"


Completed
Requirement 1 - yes
Requirement 2-  yes
Requirement 3-  yes
Requirement 4 - yes
Requirement 5 - yes
Requirment 6 - NOT DONE
Requirement 7 - Implemented some custom exceptions and Exception handling where I felt it was appropriate.
Requirement 8- Done


Why did you choose the STL containers that you implemented
* Vectors - Easy enough and logical enough where I didnt need any special lookup type functionality.
* Map - Perfect for users data. It allows me to easily lookup users, it is performant and disallows duplicates.
* (If i get time to do the recommendations) - I'd chose a combination of Map and Vector. 
I'd have something such as Map<string,vector<string>>.  The key would be a tittle. The value would be a vector of strings (recommendations)



Bonus -
Template functions - I create a couple of useful template functions

template <class T>
inline string toStr(const T& t)
{
   std::stringstream ss;
   ss <<t;
   return ss.str();
}

template <class T>
inline double toDouble(const T& t)
{
   std::stringstream is;
   is << t;
   double result;
   is >> result;
   return result;
}

handling remove of recommnend books - NOT DONE

Known issues
1) There will be memory leaks
2) I did not complete recommendations
3) I did not handle loading/saving of cart data
4) I wasn't sure what the point of the hard coded users and books was in the text file as they are input from the text file so I didn't hard code them.
