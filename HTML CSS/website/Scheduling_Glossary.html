Scheduling Concepts / Glossary
</h1>
<br />

<p>
To understand the concept of Scheduling it is a good idea to understand some of the terms that are used. 
Below is a table of the terms and an explanation of the term.

<table id="glossary">
<tr>
<td>
Multiprogramming
</td>
<td>
The ability to run more processes/threads than the cpu has cores
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Dispatcher	
</td>
<td>
Short term Scheduler. Please see the section on Short term Scheduler.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Job Scheduler
</td>
<td>
Long term Scheduler. Please see the section on Long term Scheduler.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Quantum
</td>
<td>
The slice of time a process has used before a context switch has occured.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Turnaround time
</td>
<td>
The interval of time between process submission and completion. 
This is the sum of  executing time, waiting time(Processor + I/O)
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Response time
</td>
<td>
Amount of time it takes from when a request was submitted until the first response is received.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Deadline
</td>
<td>
The time a process must complete by.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Context Switch
</td>
<td>
This is what occurs when the processor gives up the process.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
I/O Request
</td>
<td>
A process requests to do an Input/Output operation such as read a sector from a hard drive.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Blocked
</td>
<td>
When a process makes an I/O operation request it enters a blocked state because it is waiting for some I/O to occur. 
It will be blocked until the I/O request is complete. 
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Ready
</td>
<td>
A process wants to execute on the CPU. It is currently waiting in the ready queue and has not been scheduled to execute yet.
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Running
</td>
<td>
A CPU is executing the processes instructions
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Terminated
</td>
<td>
The OS has aborted a process
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
Process state transition
</td>
<td>
A process will change its state from running to blocked to ready. Going from one to the other is called a state transition
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
CPU Burst
</td>
<td>
The time that a process has on the CPU
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
IO Bound Process
</td>
<td>
A process that performs lots of IO Operations
</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>
CPU bound Process
</td>
<td>
A process that performs lots of computation and little I/O
</td>
</tr>
