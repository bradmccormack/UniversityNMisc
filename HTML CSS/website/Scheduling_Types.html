Types of Schedulers
</h1>
<br />


<p>
There are three types of schedulers. They are classified according to the roles they perform.<br />
They are<br />
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="#longterm">
Long Term Schedulers
</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#mediumterm">
Medium Term Schedulers
</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="#shortterm">
Short Term Schedulers
</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Each of these handles the co-ordination of processes differently.

Long Term Schedulers
</h2>
<br />

<p>
These are also called Job schedulers. The long term scheduler loads processes from the ready queue and loads them into 
memory ready for the CPU scheduler (Short Term Scheduler). The Long Term Schedulers role is to provide a balanced mix 
of processes for the system to handle which consists of I/O bound processes , processor bound processes and those which 
have both characteristics

</p>

<p>
You can think of the Job scheduler as a manager that makes sure a team gets the right type of work to the correct team member.
</p>

<p>
Apart from loading up the Short Term Scheduler with a balanced mix of programs the Long Term Scheduler is also 
responsible for handling multiprogramming. It must monitor the amount of running processes and make sure the rate 
of process creation is equivalent or less than the rate of processes leaving the system so as not to bog the system down.

<p>
An analogy to multiprogramming monitoring is a manager that makes sure their team doesn?t have too much work and becomes
inefficient due to work loads.

Medium Term Schedulers
</h2>
<br />

<p>
The medium term scheduler is perhaps the most simple of the schedulers. Not simple in terms of the implementation but in terms of its task.
<br />
<br />
A Medium term scheduler is responsible for handling the load or degree of multiprogramming that is present in the Operating System.
<br /><br />
It achieves reduction or increase of multiprogramming by swapping out processes.

Short Term Schedulers
</h2>
<br />


<p>
The Short Term Scheduler is also known as the CPU scheduler. Its role is to keep performance in accordance with a specified criteria. 
<br/><br/>
The Short Term Scheduler places processes from the ready queue to the running queue. The placement depends upon the criteria. 
These are detailed in Scheduling Algorithms ? Categories and Implementations. The decision is a highly detailed decision 
and depends upon the Scheduling Algorithm.<br /><br />
Another name for the Short Term Scheduler is the dispatcher. <br/>

A good summary of the above Types is in the chart 2.2.2.4 and Table 9.1 below. 
To understand from a diagrammatic perspective there is also a great chart which 
shows overviews in Figure 9.1 and 9.2 below.
